        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
        meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
        technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript.

        Sass (short for syntactically awesome style sheets) is a preprocessor
        scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style
        Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself.

        TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language
        developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type
        annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large
        applications and transpiles to JavaScript.[5] Because TypeScript is a
        superset of JavaScript, all JavaScript programs are syntactically valid
        TypeScript, but they can fail to type-check for safety reasons.
